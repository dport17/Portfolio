# Portfolio
My code portfolio.

This makes up a short preview of my programming capabilites, the projects I've worked on, and my exposure to Object-Oriented Programming. I will continue adding to this repo as my senior year continues on and I design more programs and applications using Java, Python, Node.js, ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, and a bit of front-end design (though the backend is undoubtedly my focus).

Through my courses this year, I'll be learning an array of industry standard operations and techniques for designing and implementing inoovative programs, understanding the business of technology, and prioritizing the security and reliability of my work. 

If you're here for the Network Automation, we need to talk! I am so passionate and excited to learn more about this topic, and I would be ecstatic for a reason to dive yet deeper into it. 

During my current internship, I've been heavily involved in the development and deployment of an effective automation tool, which swaps out a broken Cisco Phone for another, brand new device at the behest of an accessible, simple web application. 

Since deployment, the app has all but eliminated the previous need for communication between 3 or 4 teams, while decreasing the turnaround time on a phone replacement from as high as 6 hours down to as low as 45 minutes. In fact, depending on what phones are in stock, it has probably decreased even more! 

As I write this, I have plans to talk with Network Engineers at my current employer to develop more automation tools, which I'll work on throughout the semester.

I'd love to tell you more about all these projects and learning experiences that I've been so privileged to enjoy. Please do not hesitate to contact me!
