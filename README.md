# Portfolio
My code portfolio.

This makes up a short previw of my programming capabilites, the projects I've worked on, and my exposure to Object-Oriented Programming. I will continue adding to this repo as my senior year continues on and I continue to design programs and applications using Java, Python, Node.js, ASP.NET MVC, JavaScript, and a bit of front-end design, though the backend is undoubtedly my focus.

Through my courses this year, I'll be learning an array of industry standard operations and techniques for designing and implementing inoovative programs, understanding the business of technology, and prioritizing the security and reliability of my work.
